# HAWK-AI Reorganization Summary

## Completed Changes

### 1. Script Directory Organization ✅

Created `/home/arthurspriet/HAWK-AI/script/` directory containing:
- `test_integration.sh` - Integration testing script (moved from root)
- `start_hawk.sh` - Unified startup script for all services
- `stop_hawk.sh` - Graceful shutdown script for all services

All scripts have been made executable with proper permissions.

### 2. Open Web UI Integration ✅

Moved the entire Open Web UI application:
- **From:** `/home/arthurspriet/hawk-ai-webchat/`
- **To:** `/home/arthurspriet/HAWK-AI/open-webui/`

This consolidates the entire HAWK-AI ecosystem into a single directory structure.

### 3. Path Updates ✅

Updated all hardcoded paths in:
- `script/test_integration.sh` - Updated to reflect new Open Web UI location
- `open-webui/start_all_services.sh` - Changed to use relative paths

### 4. Unified Makefile Commands ✅

Added new commands to the Makefile:

#### `make hawk`
Starts all HAWK-AI services in one command:
1. HAWK-AI API Server (port 8000)
2. HAWK-AI Dev Backend (main.py --dev)
3. Open Web UI Backend (port 8080)
4. Open Web UI Frontend (port 5173)

Features:
- Checks if services are already running
- Starts services in background with proper logging
- Saves PIDs for easy management
- Displays service URLs and log locations
- Warns if vector database doesn't exist

#### `make stop`
Gracefully stops all HAWK-AI services:
- Stops by PID files first
- Falls back to port-based detection if needed
- Force kills if graceful shutdown fails
- Cleans up PID files

## Usage

### Starting All Services

```bash
make hawk
```

This will start:
- 🔧 HAWK-AI API: http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs
- 🛠️ HAWK-AI Dev: Running in background
- 📊 OpenWebUI Backend: http://127.0.0.1:8080/docs
- 🌐 OpenWebUI Frontend: http://localhost:5173

### Stopping All Services

```bash
make stop
```

### Viewing Logs

```bash
# All logs
tail -f logs/*.log

# Specific service
tail -f logs/api_server.log
tail -f logs/main_dev.log
tail -f open-webui/backend/backend.log
tail -f open-webui/frontend.log
```

## Directory Structure

```

## Benefits

1. **Cleaner Root Directory** - All scripts organized in dedicated folder
2. **Single Command Launch** - `make hawk` starts everything
3. **Unified Location** - All HAWK-AI components in one place
4. **Better Management** - Easy to start, stop, and monitor services
5. **Portable Scripts** - Use relative paths for better portability

## Notes

- Vector database should be initialized before first use: `make db`
- Open Web UI backend requires its own virtual environment
- Frontend requires npm packages: automatically checked on startup
- All services run in background with output logged to files

## Backward Compatibility

Existing commands still work:
- `make dev` - Run HAWK-AI dev mode
- `make api` - Run API server only
- `make db` - Rebuild vector database
- All other existing make targets remain unchanged
